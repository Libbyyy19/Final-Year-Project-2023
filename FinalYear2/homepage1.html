    <p>Welcome to the automatic assignment marker for HTML and CSS files</p>
    <p>We know that grading assignments can be a time-consuming tasks for instructors, so
        we've created a tool that automates the process and saves you valuable time.
        This assignment marker checks HTML and CSS files for errors and provides detailed feedback to help
        students improve their coding skills.
    </p>
    <p>To get started, you can either create an account or login to an already made account.
        This allows details to be saved and previous files uploaded to be saved so you do not
        get confused.
    </p>
    <p>I hope everything runs smoothly for you!</p>
